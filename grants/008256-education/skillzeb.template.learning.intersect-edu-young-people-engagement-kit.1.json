Participate in community forums and social media groups to stay updated on the latest discussions and proposals.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>Contribute to Proposals:</strong> Actively participate in submitting and reviewing governance proposals. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions to improve the quality and impact of proposals.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>Educate Yourself and Others:</strong> Continuously educate yourself on blockchain technology, Cardano&rsquo;s governance model, and relevant topics. Share your knowledge with other community members to foster a more informed and engaged community.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>Build Relationships:</strong> Network with other DReps, ADA holders, and community leaders to build strong relationships and alliances.

Always verify information from multiple reputable sources and be cautious of too-good-to-be-true offers or unsolicited requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Trolling and Negative Interactions:</strong>Encountering hostile or unproductive interactions can discourage participation and spread negativity. Focus on constructive dialogue, report abusive behavior, and surround yourself with positive community members.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflicts of Interest:</strong> Conflicts of interest can arise if personal gains are prioritized over community welfare. Maintain transparency, disclose any potential conflicts, and prioritize decisions that benefit the wider community.</li>\n<li><strong>Overwhelming </strong>Volume of Information: The vast amount of information can be overwhelming, making it difficult to stay updated and make informed decisions.&nbsp;Use reliable sources and tools to filter and manage information effectively. Focus on key updates and engage selectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Security Risks: </strong>Engaging in online discussions and transactions can expose you to phishing attacks and other security threats. Use secure communication channels, verify URLs and links before clicking, and never share private keys or sensitive information publicly.</li>\n</ul>","by":"","durationdays":{},"resources":[],"reflections":[],"supportitems":[],"_by":"","_hash":"5--Community Engagement","hash":"403cb2eb8b691bacb760b5dd513388879e8ef98f423b243ef094a8dfa0ed4087","_resourcesHTML":"","_supportItemsHTML":"","_reflectionsHTML":"","queue":"util-project-information-show-milestone"}],"hasResources":false,"hasSupportItems":false}],"skills":{"required":[{"uri":"","name":"","sdi":"","level":"00","capacity":"00","scope":{"year":""}}],"gained":[{"uri":"09680000430001","name":"Cardano dGov sanchogov.tools Register as a Voter","sdi":"6ac60118-7f7b-499b-8baa-255e23de70ed","level":"0","capacity":"00","scope":{"year":""},"_validationView":""},{"name":"Cardano dGov sanchogov.tools Register as a dRep","uri":"09680000440001","sdi":"0358edba-341b-44fe-9490-9ba552a7d2d4","_validationView":""},{"name":"Cardano dGov sanchogov.tools Registering a Governance Action","uri":"09680000450001","sdi":"d61e9536-a4d1-405f-9736-91e98eb3a00a","_validationView":""},{"name":"Cardano dGov sanchogov.tools dRep Voting on a Governance Action","uri":"09680000460001","sdi":"0c8b8da6-b43b-44b8-95fd-9bdf978a118f","_validationView":""},{"name":"Cardano dGov Forming a dRep Team","uri":"09680000470001","sdi":"f9113f71-57ef-40ae-a055-62bd93a77e58","_validationView":""},{"name":"Cardano dGov Staying Safe","uri":"09680000480001","sdi":"ca5beabb-e880-4f64-9c1f-453db0f44a70","_validationView":""}]},"title":"Cardano On-Chain Governance - Societal Empowerment in Governance Action","url":"https://cardano.org/; https://mav100.com/; https://sanchogov.tools/"}}}
